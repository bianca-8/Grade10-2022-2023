"""
Write a program that simulates the following:
100 lockers in a school all start with their doors closed.
A student walks from the first locker to the last, opening each door.

A second student then walks from the first locker to the last, changing the state of every second door, starting from the second door. In other words, if a door is open, they close it.  If the door is closed, they open it.

The process continues, the third student changing the state of every third locker starting at the third locker, etc...until 100 students have passed through.

Output the state of each of the 100 lockers.
Also, display which lockers are open, for example: 1 3 8 etc...
