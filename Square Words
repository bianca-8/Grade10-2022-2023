Write a program that asks the user to input a word.  The program then rotates the characters of the word to create a square pattern of letters. 
 
For example:  help
                    	elph
                    	lphe
                    	phel

for letter in word:
  first = word[0]
  word = word[1:] + first
  print(word)
